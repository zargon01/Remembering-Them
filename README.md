# Remembering Them

## Project Overview

"Remembering Them" is an AI-powered project aimed at bringing back deceased individuals in a virtual form by simulating their voice, mannerisms, and appearance. This project was assigned under the topic "Talk to the Dead" by the Head of Department. The goal is to create an interactive system where users can engage in a conversation with an AI that mimics the personality, speech, and appearance of a deceased person.

### Phases of the Project

The project is divided into several key phases, each involving different AI and software components:

1. **Voice Cloning**:
   - We will use AI models to clone the voice of a person based on available recordings. By training on these samples, the model will replicate the vocal characteristics of the person.

2. **Text Generation Using Large Language Models (LLMs)**:
   - By leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, we will generate text that mimics the conversational style, thoughts, and mannerisms of the deceased person.

3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**:
   - Using advanced TTS models, we will convert generated text into audio that resembles the person's actual voice, creating a realistic and natural flow of conversation.

4. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Visuals**:
   - GANs will be used to generate visuals of the person, including facial features and expressions, creating a full-body virtual representation for interactive conversations.

5. **Flutter Web App Integration**:
   - The final AI system will be integrated into a web app built using Flutter. This app will allow users to interact with the AI and engage in conversations with the replicated virtual persona.
